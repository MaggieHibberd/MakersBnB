As a user I can list a new property

Any user can list multiple spaces

A user should be able to provide a name for their space, a short description & price per night

A user should be able to put in a date range for availability

Any signed up user can request to hire a space, this hire can be approved by the owner of that space

Nights a space is already booked should not be available to booking
